Floats are a fundamental numeric data type and are used to represent real numbers, including both rational and irrational numbers. <br> Floats are created by specifying a number with a decimal point or by using exponential notation (using the letter 'e' to represent the exponent - for example: a = $1.23e-4$  will assign the value $0.000123$ to the variable a).\n",
