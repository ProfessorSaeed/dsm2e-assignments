It's a convention to use the underscore as a variable name when you need to create a variable, but you don't intend to use its value. In the context of the line `for _ in range(5):`, `for _` indicates that you're iterating over the elements produced by `range(5)`, but you don't need to use the actual values inside the loop.

    "- The process of pausing and resuming allows the generator function to produce values one at a time, making it efficient in terms of memory usage and suitable for scenarios where you don't need to generate all values at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are few Advantages and Drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Memory Efficiency (Advantage): One of the primary advantages of generator functions is their memory efficiency. They generate values on-the-fly, producing only one value at a time and avoiding the need to store the entire sequence in memory. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or potentially infinite sequences.\n",
    "    - Lazy Evaluation (Advantage): Generator functions use lazy evaluation, meaning they produce values only when requested. This can be advantageous in scenarios where you don't need all the values at once, improving performance and reducing resource consumption.\n",
    "    - Single Iteration (Drawback): Once a generator is exhausted (all values have been yielded), it cannot be iterated over again. If you need to restart the iteration, you must create a new generator instance.\n",
    "    - Limited Random Access (Drawback): Unlike sequences such as lists, generator functions provide limited random access. You can only iterate through the values sequentially, and you cannot, for example, access an element at a specific index without iterating through the preceding elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In summary, generator functions are a powerful feature in Python, especially when dealing with large datasets or sequences, but their suitability depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. They are particularly advantageous when memory efficiency and lazy evaluation are crucial."
